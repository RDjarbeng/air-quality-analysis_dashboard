# Summary
Trying to analyze some air quality data from Africa; mostly in Rwanda -Kigali to see if there are any insights.

## Data Analysis Perspective:

Data Quality and Coverage:

Total valid readings: 2,647 (after filtering out negative values)
Consistent hourly measurements with approximately 110 readings per hour
Standard deviation of 17.04 µg/m³ indicates moderate variability in measurements


Temporal Patterns:

Clear day-night variation:

Daytime average (6AM-6PM): 31.08 µg/m³
Nighttime average (6PM-6AM): 37.67 µg/m³
21.2% higher concentrations during nighttime


Hourly patterns show peak concentrations in early morning hours (around 3-4 AM)


Distribution Characteristics:

Mean PM2.5: 34.38 µg/m³
Maximum recorded value: 152.30 µg/m³
AQI Category breakdown:

Moderate: 57.5% of readings
Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups: 31.2%
Unhealthy: 10.3%
Good: 0.9%





Air Quality Perspective:

Overall Air Quality Status:

The average PM2.5 concentration of 34.38 µg/m³ exceeds WHO guidelines (annual guideline of 5 µg/m³)
Only 0.9% of readings fall in the "Good" category, indicating persistent air quality challenges
Over 41% of readings (Unhealthy + Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups) indicate significant health risks


Health Implications:

The high proportion of "Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups" (31.2%) suggests regular risks for:

People with respiratory conditions
Elderly individuals
Children and pregnant women


10.3% of readings in "Unhealthy" category indicate periods where general population may experience health effects
